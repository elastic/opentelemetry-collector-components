The Loadgen receiver is a specialized OpenTelemetry receiver designed to generate metrics, logs, and traces for testing, benchmarking, and validation purposes.

## How Telemetry Is Generated

The receiver utilizes pre-captured telemetry data from a typical OpenTelemetry Demo execution, which represents a diverse set of application scenarios and workloads. When generating telemetry, the receiver uses this base data, dynamically adjusting timestamps to match the current time. This approach ensures the generated telemetry retains the structure and content of authentic OpenTelemetry Demo data while appearing as though it were generated in real-time. The pre-captured telemetry is embedded in the receiver and can be found in [testdata](./testdata/) directory.

## Rate limiting

The receiver generates telemetry as quickly as possible. Any rate limiting should be done via backpressure using [processor/ratelimitprocessor](/processor/ratelimitprocessor).

## Telemetry cardinality

The receiver only rewrites timestamps to Now, and does not modify any other fields. Therefore, it will have the same cardinality as the original canned data. To simulate higher cardinality (e.g. trace ID, service name), use `transform` processor with OTTL to rewrite fields. 

## Config

See [./config.go](./config.go) for configurations.
