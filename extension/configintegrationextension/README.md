This extension allows to define integrations embedded in the collector
configuration file. These integrations can be then used with the integration
receiver or the integration processor.

## Configuration

**integrations**

Map with the embedded definition of integrations. The key of the map is the name
of the integration, that can be referenced by other components using
integrations. The value is a string with YAML content defining an integration.
Variables in the integration use the same syntax as other variables, but they need
to be escaped with a double `$$` so they are resolved when the integration is
instantiated.

## Example

The following configuration defines an integration called "somelog" that is reused
in two pipelines, using the integration receiver and the integration processor.

```yaml
extensions:
  config_integrations:
    integrations:
      somelog: |
        receivers:
          filelog:
            include: $${var:paths}
            start_at: beginning

        processors:
          transform/resource:
            log_statements:
              - set(log.attributes["resource"], "$${var:resource}")

        pipelines:
          logs:
            receiver: filelog
            processors:
              - transform/resource

receivers:
  integration:
    name: "somelog"
    pipelines: "logs"
    parameters:
      paths: "/var/log/somelog-*.log"
      resource: "example"

  filelog:
    include: "/var/log/otherlog-*.log"

processors:
  integration:
    name: "somelog"
    pipelines: "logs"
    parameters:
      resource: "other"

exporters: ...

service:
  extensions: [file_integrations]
  pipelines:
    logs/somelog:
      receivers: [integration]
      exporters: ...
    logs/otherlog:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [integration]
      exporters: ...
```
