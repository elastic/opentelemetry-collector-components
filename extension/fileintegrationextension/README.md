This extension allows to provide integrations installed on local files.
These integrations can be then used with other components such as the
integration receiver or the integration processor.

## Configuration

**path**

Path to the directory containing integrations. Other components can use the name
of each file, without extension, to reference them as integrations.

## Example

Integrations are defined in YAML format, with a structure similar to the
collector configuration. They can define receivers, processors, and pipelines.

For example the following integration would define a logs receiver based on the
`filelog` receiver and the `transform` processor:
```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: ${var:paths}
    start_at: beginning

processors:
  transform/resource:
    log_statements:
      - set(log.attributes["resource"], "${var:resource}")

pipelines:
  logs:
    receiver: filelog
    processors:
      - transform/resource
```

If this template would be installed for example in the `/etc/opentelemetry/integrations/somelog.yaml`
file, it could be used with the following configuration, that creates two
pipelines, one uses the integration as receiver, and another one uses it as a
processor.

```yaml
extensions:
  file_integrations:
    path: "/etc/opentelemetry/integrations"

receivers:
  integration:
    name: "somelog"
    pipelines: "logs"
    parameters:
      paths: "/var/log/somelog-*.log"
      resource: "example"

  filelog:
    include: "/var/log/otherlog-*.log"

processors:
  integration:
    name: "somelog"
    pipelines: "logs"
    parameters:
      resource: "other"

exporters: ...

service:
  extensions: [file_integrations]
  pipelines:
    logs/somelog:
      receivers: [integration]
      exporters: ...
    logs/otherlog:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [integration]
      exporters: ...
```
