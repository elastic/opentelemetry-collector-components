# Releasing opentelemetry-collector-components

1. Determine the version number that will be assigned to the release. It should
   match the latest upstream release version (`OTEL_VERSION`).

2. Open a PR to the repository to use the newly released OpenTelemetry Collector Core version by doing the following:
   - Ensure your local repository is up-to-date with upstream and create a new Git branch named `release/<release-series>` (e.g. `release/v0.85.x`)
   - Manually update core and contrib collector module versions in
     `../distributions/elastic-components/manifest.yaml`
   - Manually update the version to be released in the [versions.yaml file](../versions.yaml)
   - Run `make genelasticcol`
   - Commit the changes
   - Run `make update-otel OTEL_VERSION=vX.Y.Z OTEL_STABLE_VERSION=vA.B.C`
     - If there is no new stable version released in the core collector, use the current stable module version in contrib as `OTEL_STABLE_VERSION`.
   - If you were unable to run `make update-otel` before releasing core, fix any errors from breaking changes.
   - Commit the changes
   - Open the PR

3. Make sure you are on the `release/<release-series>` branch. Tag the module groups with the new release version by running:

   ‚ö†Ô∏è If you set your remote using `https`, you need to include `REMOTE=https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-collector-components.git` in each command. ‚ö†Ô∏è

   - Run `make push-tags`.

   If you encounter an error when running `make push-tags` like:

   ```
   Load key "~/.ssh/id_ed25519": incorrect passphrase supplied to decrypt private key error: unable to sign the tag
   ```

   It‚Äôs likely because Git is trying to sign a tag using an SSH key that requires a passphrase.

   ‚úÖ Solution: Run the following commands to decrypt your SSH key and make it available for Git tag signing:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add <YOUR_SSH/GPG_KEY_PATH>
   make push-tags
   ```
