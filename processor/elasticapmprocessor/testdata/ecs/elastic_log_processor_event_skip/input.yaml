# Scenario: log records with processor.event originate from the Elastic APM
# intake receiver (elasticapmintakereceiver). OTLP log attribute conventions
# (move-to-labels) and body conventions must NOT be applied to these records,
# because their attributes follow the Elastic APM schema, not OTel conventions.
