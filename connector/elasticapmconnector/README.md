## Configuration

By design, this component has minimal configuration. An empty configuration will be functional
though we would not recommend this for production workloads.

By default, all aggregation state is maintained in-memory. The aggregation state can be stored
on disk instead by specifying `elasticapm::aggregation::directory`, which should be a directory
dedicated to this purpose.

By default, aggregated metrics will be exported without any client metadata. It is possible to
propagate client metadata from input to exported metrics by specifying a list of metadata keys
in `elasticapm::aggregation::metadata_keys`.

```yaml
elasticapm:
  aggregation:
    directory: /path/to/aggregation/directory
    metadata_keys: [list, of, metadata, keys]
```
