## Configuration

By design, this component has minimal configuration. An empty configuration will be functional
though we would not recommend this for production workloads; aggregation state should be stored
on disk to avoid extreme memory usage under high throughput.

By default, all aggregation state is maintained in-memory. The aggregation state can be stored
on disk instead by specifying `elasticapm::aggregation::directory`, which should be a directory
dedicated to this purpose.

By default, aggregated metrics will be exported without any client metadata. It is possible to
propagate client metadata from input to exported metrics by specifying a list of metadata keys
in `elasticapm::aggregation::metadata_keys`.

```yaml
elasticapm:
  aggregation:
    directory: /path/to/aggregation/directory
    metadata_keys: [list, of, metadata, keys]
```

### Metrics produced by the connector

| Metric                                          | Source Signal       | OTel Metric Type     | ES Mapping Type         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `service_summary`                               | Logs, Metric, Spans | Sum                  | Double                  |
| `span.destination.service.response_time.sum.us` | Spans               | Sum                  | Double                  |
| `span.destination.service.response_time.count`  | Spans               | Sum                  | Double                  |
| `transaction.duration.histogram`                | Spans               | Histogram            | [Histogram](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/histogram.html)               |
| `transaction.duration.summary`                  | Spans               | Histogram (1 bucket) | [Aggregate Metric Double](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/aggregate-metric-double.html) |
| `event.success_count`                           | Spans               | Histogram (1 bucket) | [Aggregate Metric Double](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/aggregate-metric-double.html) |

Above is a list of metrics that are produced by the connector. There are few noteworthy points that needs to be documented:

1. [elasticsearch.mapping.hints](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-dev/blob/main/docs/design-decisions/ingest/mapping.md#mapping-hints) attributes are used to bridge the gap for mapping OTel data types to Elasticsearch mappings.
2. `transaction.duration.{histogram, summary}` metrics are produced with different set of attributes to represent transaction duration grouped by transaction type or by more granular transaction attributes. These are identified by `metricset.name` attribute set to `service_transaction` or `transaction` respectively.
3. `event.success_count` metric is derived from the [enriched event.outcome attribute](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-lib/blob/1b69a60c8a2c4f608527fa938dc4e3ab0b991089/enrichments/trace/internal/elastic/span.go#L356-L374). The metric is produced as a histograms with a single bucket where `count` represents the total number of spans and `value` represents the total number of spans with `event.outcome` as `success`. We use a histogram as it is the closest metric type that can be mapped to the aggregate metric double field in Elasticsearch. The [aggregate_metric_double mapping hint](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-dev/blob/main/docs/design-decisions/ingest/mapping.md#mapping-hints) is added as an attribute to signal [Elasticsearch exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter) to do the conversion to aggregate metric double.
